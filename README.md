Cars Model Classification based on 196 classes using different CNN architectures
Detecting the cars model with its image is very important. It actually helps in prevent crimes or any kind of wrong activity. This is an important task in the area of traffic control and management. Typically, to build this kind of detection model we are going to use Stanford Cars dataset containing 196 different classes of cars. Now, implementing this kind of classification task is very challenging job due to the lot of differences in the images of cars based on its shape, size and poses. Next, we need to design, implement, and test the best Deep Learning framework for the fine-grained classification. In this research, we also need to select the best CNN architecture in order to obtain the high quality result. We compare the architecture accuracy as well as its complexity to get the best classifier.
